    <h3>Transportation:</h3>
    <p>
      Homer is a 4hr drive south from Anchorage airport. You have the option 
      to rent a car from Anchorage (the views will blow you away), or there 
      is a plane that flies to Homer (please check the website for schedules) 
      and in Homer you can rent a car.
    </p>

    <h3>Lodging:</h3>
    <p>
      We’ve reserved a house with a million dollar view for the week. This will 
      be the gathering site for our get-togethers and meals. It has a large common 
      room for gatherings, a deck, and a large lawn that leads to the beach 
      (bonfires anyone?!).
